A single martyr is a tragedy; a hundred martyrs is a statistic.

“Will you give all you can give. So that our banner may advance?” Borrowing the content from another post, these lyrics should be the closest to describe the martyr. I believe he had completely thought through what he gave up everything for. It is the most difficult to be the vanguard. He successful made Hong Kong care by sacrificing his life.

But anyone who is thinking to use martyrdom to send a message to the government, I strongly advise you not to do it. Why? Because it will not help anything. It would just end up as personal venting for yourself. Being the second, third person would simply depreciate the efforts of this martyr.

One martyr might motivate one million to go on the streets, but would two, three martyrs bring two, three million? More martyrs would just create numbness in everyone. When martyrdom becomes normal, nobody would care anymore, or be saddened.

If you really want to sacrifice your life to protect your homeland, then please consider thoroughly what are you spending your life for. Do something meaningful. Give all you can give.
