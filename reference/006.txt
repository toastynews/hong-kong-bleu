Since the 9th, I witnessed a different LIHKG

Before, LIHKGers love to criticize everything.

For legislators, they called them crooks.

But Roy Kwong ran around whole night and passed out from exhaustion.

And Alvin Yeung went to Admiralty to help youngsters challenge the police.

For Hong Kong girls, they called them prostitutes and sluts.

And lately a lot of Hong Kong girls chose to be at the front lines.

For guys, they called them fatty, shorty, morons and geeks.

And today many brothers chose to protect Hong Kong.

For Christians, they chastised them for being idiotic and annoying.

But Christians chose to protect the protestors.

For South Asians, they lambasted them for raping women for leisure.

But South Asians chose to fight alongside Hong Kongers.

For taxi drivers, they berated them for being impolite.

But today a taxi driver crashed into a dog car.

Slowly, I discovered that it is possible to build a fellowship of Hong Kongers.

We just have to align our goals, and point our guns outward.

Actually, there are a lot of things to love about Hong Kong.

Add oil, Hong Kongers!
