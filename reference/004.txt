*** Important ***

An hour ago I got verified information from a pro bono lawyer, someone has been arrested at a public hospital.

So, here is the lowdown.

If you got hurt and seek treatment in the hospital, we medical staff need to know your injury mechanism: for example, how you got hit by bullets, or got hit by a stick, etc. This information is useful for the medical staff.

But then information about whether you are a protestor, bystander, rioter, police or triad, and why you happened to be there, why you got beat up, etc, are not necessary, and are medically irrelevant.

Remember, doctors and nurses are not police, we have no right to force you to talk, especially about irrelevant stuff.

Remember, hospitals have more than medical staff.

Hospitals, like all other places in the world, have many kind of people.

#think about what I said above

#what can be said

#what should not be said

#protect yourself

#donâ€™t get hurt

#always seek medical treatment if injured

#but continue to protect yourself even after getting into the hospital
