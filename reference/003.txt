I noticed something odd that I will describe here. I do not have a firm conclusion yet, but please think about this.

I think, if something is delayed a day, it is an accident. If something is delayed a week, then it is a plan.

We may have focused all our attention on the protest this Sunday, but this is something the government cannot stop effectively. The impact probably would not be very different from the last protest.

What I’m confused about, is the sudden announcement about not meeting on Monday and Tuesday. This is strange. If they simply want to delay, they can just meet as planned. After all, to show the government’s determination, everyone already expected them to push Bill through the Second Reading. We were basically waiting for the date of the Third Reading.

If the government decided to retreat, they did not need to delay. From the way they actively prevented the purchase of protective gear, and attacked the protestor’s supply points, we can see that their short-term goals is to minimize the equipment and resources available to citizens.

And then to start spreading rumors about a softening, to create the appearance of retreat, essentially it is to reduce the morale of the resistance.

A dog that barks does not bite. So, what if you see a barking dog start to quiet down? There is a high probability that it has changed its mind, and is preparing to strike.

There could be a lot of possibilities for delaying two days. If this was a game, it would be to recharge combat power. This means giving troops sufficient rest, arrange more budget, reinforce mental strength, and activate or deliver better equipment, or to plan some unprecedented bold tactics. I’ll make an imprecise prediction: the real attack will come around the 19th or 20th.

This is not a good sign no matter how I look at it.
