I noticed some visions, and I said it.
I don't have a good conclusion, but please think about it.

I think, if a day delay, is an accident.
If it is delayed by a week, it is a plan.

We may focus on Sunday's march, but it should be something the government can't effectively stop, and his effect should not be much different from the last one.

I am more puzzled that suddenly Monday two not to meet this matter, this is not unusual, if they simply want to delay time, then they can actually meet as usual. After all, even if the second reading is passed , signaling the Government's determination , we actually expect , and then another date and so on .

If they want to back down, they don't need to delay, and from these two or three days the government's aggressive defensive equipment purchases, as well as the strike supply points, can be seen in their short-term strategic objectives, which are to compress the citizens' equipment and logistical strength.

And everywhere put the wind, pretend to retreat, this is essentially to soften the morale of the struggle.

Dogs that bark don't bite, then, what if you see a dog that barks for a thousand dollars, slowly quiet down? That probably means, it has changed its mind, is preparing to bite.

Two days of delay, there are many possibilities, if it is playing a game, is to supplement combat effectiveness. This means giving troops plenty of rest, more budgets, psychological construction, and better equipment to turn on or transport. Or make bolder tactics than ever before. I make a not very reliable guess, the other side's real offensive, is will be on the nineteenth, twentyth.

It's not a good thing to see.
