A person's suicide is a story, a hundred suicides are numbers.

"Will you give all you can give
So thour banner may advance "
Borrow the content sits next to the post brother
The lyrics describe the martyr as the closest
I'm sure he's thought all about what he's giving for.
to be the first person, is very difficult
He gave his life, to get the attention of all Hong Kong, very successful.

If you have suicidal thoughts, to death to sue the government
I advise you not to go into practice.
Why? Because it doesn't help, it's just that you're venting your feelings.
You have to be someone else, a third person, and you'll only consume the life of that martyr.

A suicide could inspire a million people to take to the streets.
But will there be two million or three million suicides?
More people commit suicide only to make others more numb.
When suicide becomes the norm, no one will pay attention, and then sad.

If you want to defend your home with your life,
Please think about what you're trying to give your life for.
should go for more meaningful things give all you can give give
