I noticed some vision, I said it. I do not have very good conclusions, but please think about it. I think, if you delay one day, is an accident. If a week is delayed, it is a plan. We may all focus on the Sunday march, but it should be impossible for the Government to effectively stop it, and its effect should not be much different from the previous march. Instead, I am more puzzled about the fact that suddenly there is no meeting on Tuesdays, which is not unusual, and if they simply want to delay time, they can actually meet as usual. After all, even if it was adopted on second reading, it was a sign of the Government's determination, it was actually expected that it would be followed by another date and wait for the third reading. If they have plans to retreat, there is no need for delay, and the government's proactive approach to the acquisition of equipment for these two and three days, as well as the fight against supply points, it is clear that their short-term strategic objectives,is to compress citizens' equipment with logistical forces. And the wind everywhere and the appearance of retreat, essentially to soften the morale of the struggle. A barking dog doesn't bite, what if you see a dog that keeps barking, slowly calm down? That probably means that it has changed its intentions and is preparing to bite. If you delay two days, there are many possibilities, and if you play a game, it is to add combat power. This means giving troops adequate rest, arranging more budgets, doing mental construction, and opening or transporting better equipment. or to make more bold tactics than ever before. I make a guess that is not very reliable. The real offensive of the other side will be on the 19th and 20th. This is not a good phenomenon.
