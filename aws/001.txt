One person suicide is a story, a hundred people suicide coefficient number “Will you give all you can give So that ourbanner may advance” borrowed from the quarantined post bater, the lyrics describe a martyr who should be closest to me, and I believe he has thought about what he is.It's very difficult to pay all those who are the first ones, to pay their lives, to get the attention of the whole territory, very successful. If you have the idea of suicidal suicidal suicidal suicidal suicidal suicidal suicidal sue the government, I advise you to do it.What? Because it doesn't help you, it's just you exhale your feelings, you're going to be a second person, a third person, only consuming the life of a martyr. One suicide could trigger a million people to go to the streets, but two.Three suicides will be two million, three million? When suicide becomes the norm, no one will pay attention and grief if you really want to defend your homeland with your life, you should think about it.You should give all you can give your life for something more meaningful.
