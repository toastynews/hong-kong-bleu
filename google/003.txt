I noticed some visions, I said it.
I don't have a good conclusion, but please think about it.

I think that if you delay one day, it is an accident.
If it is delayed for a week, it is a plan.

We may all focus on the Sunday parade, but this should not be effectively prevented by the government. His effect should not be much different from the last parade.

I am more puzzled. It is unusual to suddenly not meet on Monday. If they simply want to delay time, they can actually meet as usual. After all, even if they read the second reading, they will signal the governmentâ€™s determination. In fact, I expected it, and then I will read it again for another date.

If they have plans to withdraw, they do not need to delay, and from the two or three days of the government's active prevention of equipment purchases, as well as combating supply points, it can be seen that their short-term strategic goal is to compress the equipment and logistics of the citizens. .

And put the wind everywhere, pretending to retreat, this is essentially to soften the morale of the struggle.

The dog will not bite, then, if you see a dog that is constantly licking, slowly calm down? That may mean that it has changed its intentions, is preparing to bite.

If you delay the two days, there are many possibilities. If you play the game, it is to supplement the combat effectiveness. This means giving the troops a full rest, arranging more budget, doing psychological construction, and opening or transporting better equipment. Or make a bolder tactic than ever before. I make a guess that is not very reliable. The opponent's real offensive will be on the 19th and 20th.

This is not a good phenomenon.
