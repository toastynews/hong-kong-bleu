One person commits suicide, one hundred people commit suicide numbers

"Will you give all you can give
So that our banner may advance"
Borrowing the use of isolation post
The lyrics describe the martyr should be the closest
I believe that the channel has already considered how to pay for everything.
It’s very difficult to be the first person to be the first person.
The channel has given life and it has been very successful in Hong Kong.

If you have suicidal thoughts, you should sue the government
I advise you to really implement it.
Point solution? Because it helps you, it’s just a matter of venting your feelings.
You have to be a second person, a third person, and you will only spend the life of the martyrs.

Suicide by one person may inspire one million people to go to the streets
But two or three people will have two million or three million suicides?
More suicides will only make others more numb
When suicide becomes the norm, then the monks will pay attention and then go to the heart.

If you really want to use your life to defend your homeland,
Please consider before you think that you are a beggar and have to give your life.
Should go for more meaningful things, give all you can give
