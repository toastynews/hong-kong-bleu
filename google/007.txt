[Anti-Fugitive Regulations Parade] 25-year-old Guangzhou youths come to Hong Kong to record: I hope Hong Kong will not fall

The FDC launched a march today (9th) to oppose the amendment of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. The police estimate that 153,000 people will leave the Victoria Park. Scholar Lei Dingming estimates that as of 4:45, the total number is about 199,500. The reporter saw at the scene that in addition to the Hong Kong people who screamed in the "reverse delivery" slogan, there was no shortage of Mandarin speakers.

Nathan, 25, is a member of the team. He introduced himself to the machinery industry and is a Jiangsu native living in Guangzhou. This time, specially came from Guangzhou, Nathan wanted to use the camera to record the Hong Kong people's anti-reform parade. "You Hong Kong people are not afraid of death." Nathan felt that although she did not understand Cantonese, she could feel "a collective consciousness."

I was interviewed by Guoan for forwarding news.

He shared his own experience, saying that he had been interviewed by national security personnel because of the reference to sensitive news in the mainland. Therefore, when he came to Hong Kong this time, he specially put on sunglasses and refused the reporter's request for a positive photo, fearing that the safety of himself and his family would be threatened.

Nathan said that since the beginning of secondary school, I have been to Hong Kong several times. I believe that there are many Chinese traditions that have been lost in the Mainland. I bluntly say, "I want to cherish Hong Kong, so I am afraid that it will fall."
